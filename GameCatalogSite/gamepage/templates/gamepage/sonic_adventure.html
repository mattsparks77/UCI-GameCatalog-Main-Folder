        On Angel Island, a tribe of echidnas lives in harmony with the Chao. The Chao are peaceful creatures
        that protect the all-powerful Master Emerald, which balances the power of the seven mystical Chaos Emeralds.
        One of the echidnas, Tikal, befriends Chaos, an entity who protects the Chao. The power-hungry echidnas try
        to steal the power of the Master Emerald, massacring the Chao in the process. Horrified, Chaos harnesses the
        power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos. Chaos destroys the island, but
        is stopped when Tikal seals herself and Chaos inside the Master Emerald.
        <br><br>
        Thousands of years later, Doctor Robotnik, a mad scientist, plots to get rid of his longtime nemesis Sonic,
        obtain the Chaos Emeralds, and conquer the world. Robotnik learns of Chaos and shatters the Master Emerald,
        releasing him and Tikal. Knuckles, the only remaining echidna, sets out to find the shards of the Master Emerald,
         while Sonic and his sidekick Tails try to stop Robotnik from retrieving the Chaos Emeralds. Meanwhile, Robotnik
         activates several robots, including one named Gamma, to find Froggy, an amphibian who has eaten a Chaos Emerald.
         Froggy is also pursued by the angler Big, his owner. One of Sonic's friends, Amy, discovers a Flicky in possession
         of a Chaos Emerald and names it Birdie. They are captured by Gamma and the robots, but Amy persuades Gamma not to
        work for Robotnik and to help her escape.
        <br><br>
        Eventually, Robotnik gathers the Chaos Emeralds and feeds them to Chaos, who uses them to transform into Perfect
        Chaos. Perfect Chaos destroys Station Square so Robotnik can build his ideal paradise atop its ruins. Sonic, however,
        uses Chaos Emeralds to transform into his super form and defeats Chaos. Chaos calms down when he sees the Chao living
        peacefully in Station Square and disappears with Tikal. Realizing he has lost, Robotnik flees, and Sonic chases him to
        places unknown.

        Sonic Adventure is a platformer action video game with role-playing elements.[1] Players control one of six anthropomorphic
        protagonists as they venture to defeat Doctor Robotnik and his robot army, who seek the seven magical Chaos Emeralds and the
        evil entity Chaos. Six player characters are unlocked as the game progresses, each with their own story and attributes. Sonic
        the Hedgehog performs a spin dash, homing attack, and light-speed dash; Miles "Tails" Prower flies, swims, and attacks robots
        using his tails; Knuckles the Echidna glides, climbs walls, and punches; Amy Rose can defeat enemies using her hammer; Big the
        Cat is slow and carries a fishing rod he can cast, and E-102 Gamma can shoot laser beams.[2][3]</br>
    	</br>
        At the start of the game, the player is placed in one of several Adventure Fields, open-ended hub worlds inhabited by advice-giving
        non-player characters. The player character is guided and instructed by the voice of Tikal the Echidna. Through exploration, the
        player discovers entrances to levels called Action Stages, some of which must be opened using keys hidden in the Adventure Field.
        [4]:141â€”142 Once the player accesses an Action Stage, they are tasked with a specific objective, which is different for each character.
        [5] Sonic and Amy must reach the level's end; Tails must reach the end before Sonic; Knuckles must find three hidden shards of the Master
        Emerald; Big must fish for his pet frog, and Gamma must fight his way through stages using projectiles as a defense.[3][4]:140
    	</br></br>
        Some levels include minigames separate from the main story. These feature different styles of gameplay, among them rail shooting,
        racing, and sandboarding. Some minigames can only be accessed with particular characters. Fulfilling certain objectives allows the
        player to obtain bonus items. Unlocked minigames and stages the player has completed can be accessed from a Trial Mode on the title

        Like previous Sonic the Hedgehog games, players collect golden rings as a form of health: if the player character is in possession of
        rings when they are hit by an enemy or other hazard, they will survive, but their rings will scatter and blink before disappearing.
        Canisters containing power-ups such as speed shoes, additional rings, invincibility, and elemental shields are also hidden in levels.
        In several stages, the player engages Robotnik or Chaos in a boss fight and must deplete the boss's health meter to proceed.[6][7] Each
        character starts with a limited number of lives, and the player loses a life if the character drowns, gets crushed, or is hit without
        any rings in their possession. Losing all lives ends the game. Lives can be replenished by collecting 100 rings or a 1-up.[3]
    	</br></br>
        Players may also discover Chao Gardens, hidden, protective environments inhabited by Chao, a virtual pet. Players can hatch, name, and
        interact with a Chao,[6] and raise the status of their Chao by giving it small animals found by defeating robots. The Dreamcast's handheld
        Visual Memory Unit (VMU) allows the player to download the minigame Chao Adventure, in which their Chao walks through a course to evolve
        and improve its skills.[5][8] Evolving one's Chao improves its performance in competitions called Chao Races. Eggs that can produce special
        types of Chao are hidden throughout the Adventure Fields. Players can earn emblems by playing through Action Stages, searching through the
        Adventure Fields, or winning Chao Races.[2][9] Each Action Stage has three emblems that can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling
        objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.[3]
